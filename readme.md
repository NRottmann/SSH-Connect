# SSH Client for Android

This Application for Android allows to open a shell via SSH connection, such that commands can send and data be read.



## Requirements

* Android Studio (Version 3.5.3)

  

## Usage

Start the application and insert username, password, IP address and port number into the provided fields. For example, a standard raspberry pi  could have the below shown configurations

<p float="left" align="middle">
  <img src="/pics/1.jpg" title="Choice" width="300 hspace="50" />
  <img src="/pics/2.jpg" width="300 hspace="50" />
</p>

Pushing the "OPEN SSH" button leads to an log in procedure and opens the shell. Afterwards, we can send any command to the shell by typing it into the provided field and pressing the "SEND" button. For example, we can send the Linux shell command "ls".

<p float="left" align="middle">
  <img src="/pics/3.jpg" title="Choice" width="300 hspace="50" />
  <img src="/pics/4.jpg" width="300 hspace="50" />
</p>

To close the connection simply hit the "CLOSE SSH" button.
